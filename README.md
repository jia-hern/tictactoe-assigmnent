1. Ask for names of players 1 and 2.
2. Alternate between input for player 1 and player 2.
3. Stop when one of the players has won.

**Assessment criteras**

- Correctness of code
- A repo with run instructions
- Cover code by unit testing
- Include comments

## Breakdown

#### Minimum Viable Product Features

1. Ask for names of players 1 and 2.
2. Alternate between input for player 1 and player 2.
3. Stop when one of the players has won.

#### What to add from there

1. Unit testing
2. Validation of user input, for names and x/o

#### Approach

##### Sprint 1 - Thurs

- Was fiddling around with prompt on node and it was a nightmare to perform CRUD in node

##### Sprint 2 - Fri

- python does something similar so lets use that

##### Sprint 3 - Sat

-

#### Bugs & Issues Faced

- keying inputs directly into the noce terminal and manipulating the data from there

**Run instructions**
