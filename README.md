#### App Objectives

- Implement a text based 2-player tic-tac-toe game. The players would need to take turns at placing an X or an O on a 3x3 board.

**Requirements**

1. Ask for names of players 1 and 2.
2. Alternate between input for player 1 and player 2.
3. Stop when one of the players has won.

**Assessment criteras**

- Correctness of code
- A repo with run instructions
- Cover code by unit testing
- Include comments

## Breakdown

#### Minimum Viable Product Features

1. Ask for names of players 1 and 2.
2. Alternate between input for player 1 and player 2.
3. Stop when one of the players has won.

#### What to add from there

1. Unit testing
2. Validation of user input, for names and x/o (done)

#### Approach

##### Sprint 1 - Thurs

- Was fiddling around with prompt on node and it was a nightmare to perform CRUD in node

##### Sprint 2 - Fri

- Trying to use an index. html was starting to complicate this unnecessarily
- python does something similar so lets use that

##### Sprint 3 - Sat

- Debugging

##### Sprint 4 - Sun

- broke down the code into smaller functions
- included validation for user inputs

#### Bugs & Issues Faced

- keying inputs directly into node terminal and manipulating the data from there
